# AutomaticDateAddVBA
This is a VBA script for excel which I use to insert a time for when I have worked out and make the specified row green. Take a look at the spreadsheet to see how it in action. If you want to look at the VBA code by itself or need to copy it for yourself the code is available in a seperate file. 
The Week at the top left of the sheet tracks your weeks, so once you have filled up this week, you can make a copy of the sheet by selecting the sheet at the bottom making a copy and moving to the end, and the week will automatically update.
