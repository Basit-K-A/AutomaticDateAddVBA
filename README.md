# AutomaticDateAddVBA
This is a VBA script for excel which I use to insert a time for when I have worked out and make the specified row green. Take a look at the spreadsheet to see how it in action. If you want to look at the VBA code by itself or need to copy it for yourself the code is available in a seperate file.
